# Reddit-ReverseVideoBot

[Inspiration for this bot](https://sandiegofreepress.org/2017/11/one-veterans-dream-kurt-vonneguts-war-in-reverse-video-worth-watching/#.X0qiLS2z2Dc)

## How To Use

**•** To call this bot, just comment `!ReverseVideo` under any reddit post with a video. It also works for *GIFS*.

**•** The bot posts the video to [Streamable](https://www.streamable.com) and replies to the comment with a link to the reversed video's Streamable page. However, it will take a few minutes for the video to be uploaded properly, so the link won't work at first.
